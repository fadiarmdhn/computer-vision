# Digital Image Processing Projects

## About the projects
Some of these projects are part of my assignment in Digital Image Processing (KOM342) course during the 6th semester. This course explains the relationship between Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, image processing and computer vision, digital image characteristics, image formation, image enhancement, image restoration, image transformation in frequency space, image segmentation, image morphology, image compression, feature extraction, and image recognition.

## Tools
* PyCharm (IDE)
* Python 3.7 (programming language)
* OpenCV (library)
